Welcome to my new webpage, I have a lot of projects that are fun or use full so be sure to take a look around the site, maybe you'll even find some easter eggs.

For my personal use, this post is going to have every element i can put in my blog in it.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

This theme supports **link posts**, made famous by John Gruber. To use, just add `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to the post's YAML front matter and you're done.
Some [link](#) can also be shown.
