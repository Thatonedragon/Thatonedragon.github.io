First of all, yes, yes i'm realy becomming an engineer, electrotech to be precise, but my passion does not stop at being that engineer that sits behind his desk, only doing research and simulation of working components, no, I want to be the one that concepts, designs, prototypes, and build the very first version of a project.
In order to accomplish this goal, I will need to have skills from the field, I do this by doing stuff that is normaly done by a professional.

Here is my way to work on such a skill

1. Start by doing research
   
   It's crucial to know what you're up against before starting something that may be too much to handle at that moment.
2. If near, ask somebody who has experience in the skill you are pursuing to be at your side.
3. Prepare the tools you're going to make use of.
4. Wear the correct clothes!
   
   Rule of thummb, if it concerns modifying the form of material, wear full body covering clothes.
5. Start and stay organised!
   

So now why I made this post! 

Yesterday, all my troubles see---- wait that's a song, Yesterday i welded for the first time in my life, and i'm going to let you experience it step for step!

My mother has a bunch of horses to take care of, and her father has a little vegetable garden right next to the horseland. The horses like to go on a "buffet a volont√©" eating the plants my grandfather so carefully planted.
This needed a solution.
Before we had an electric line going over the standard fence, but the hooks broke off and thus the line was down. So we had to come up with a better solution!

This time, we bought some bigger hooks, with a longer metal part, the problem is, how do we fix it to the metal pole? like before? nuts and bolts were welded to the small hooks?
An idea that failed should not be reused, so this time we decided to weld the bigger hooks directly to the pole and leaving the nuts and bolts out
