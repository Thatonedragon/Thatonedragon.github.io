First of all, yes, yes i'm realy becomming an engineer, electrotech to be precise, but my passion does not stop at being that engineer that sits behind his desk, only doing research and simulation of working components, no, i want to be the one that concepts, designs, prototypes, and build the very first version of a project.
In order to accomplish this goal I need to have skills from the field, i do this by doing stuff that is normaly done by a professional.

Here is my way to work on such a skill

1. Start by doing research
   It's crucial to know what you're up against before starting something that may be too much to handle at that moment.
2. If near, ask somebody who has experience in the skill you are pursuing to be at your side.
3. Prepare the tools you're going to make use of.
4. Wear the correct clothes!
   Rule of thummb, if it concerns modifying the form of material, wear full body covering clothes.
5. Start and stay organised!
