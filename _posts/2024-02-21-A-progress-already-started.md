## Before the contract, there was work
From the start of the school year 2023-24, together with Quentin Fache and Pierre-alex Bianchi, we took the Association from where it was, to where it is now, that is to 
say, going from an unorganised mess, to a lesser unorganised mess, to now a respectable kind of unorganised mess.
You see, at the start there where only a handfull of members, but this year, the number flew up to almost 10% from the first years, second years, and thirds years.
With so much members, you're almost unable to monitor everyone and everything, and we did a lot to optimise the working space, access to tools.
Reducing the number of boxes for all our components was already a huge improvement, then came the big cleanup of stuff that couldn't be used anymore, after that, we 
recently did another components boxes merge, which reduced space again!
