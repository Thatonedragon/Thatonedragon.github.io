Since I was little, I've always been passionate about creating things and how things work. Fast forward to today, this passion became my hobby and domain of studies.

By integrating Unilasalle amiens, I've been given access to a large base of knowlege, enabling me to continue discovering, and 
going into the depths of what I already knew.


## Context

When I joined the engineering course that Unilasalle proposed, a clear interest in digitial electronics became apparent. So I continued my autonomous research by doing small projects,
I sometimes made them, sometimes they stayed theoretical, but they helped me understand most of the concepts behind electronics.

As from 2022, I joined a robotics club, and quickly realised that there are people like me that are passionate about the world of makers, which meant that I could finally share knowledge with people around me and learn even more from them.
Not soon after I arrived, the then Co-Director RÃ©mi Lacombe told me I was a good candidate for the next years council of the robotics club. So I did, together with Quentin Fache and Pierre-Alex Bianchi, we brought Unimakers to the next level.

## What seemed simple, was a hell of a challenge

As the header says, it was not that simple, finances where all over the place, the club was not 
organized, presence on social media was nearly absent, and people went in and out without being member of the club. Change was needed.

I took the role of technical director (previously Robotics director). I'm in charge of the physical and project part of the club.
I also play a small role for the social media account for instagram. Quentin is in charge of finance and sponsoring.

## The deal with the dev---- Unilasalle
Very fast, I found myself overwelmed with a lot of thing that I didn't have time for in a 14 hour day , I started to compromise 
health and sleep to do everything possible on time, which usualy translated to going to bed a 2 o'clock in the morning and to wake 
up again at 7, this on repeat! I won't do the math for you, but there was not a lot of sleep remaining, only cofee!
At one point I even started working on things during lessons, at that point I had enough. It was time to change something.
There where multiple options for me to take:
    - doing less work 
    - compromise studies (not an option)
    - no social life
    - no more family
    - A study contract

The last option was the most interesting, as it enabled me to use schools hours to work on the club, whose first goal is to animate
student life. This made a lot of sense, spending time at school, for school, and for the club , during school hours.

Today the contract was accepted, and as soon as my first hour of the contract started, I repurpused this webpage of mine for the study contract, it's a way for the professors to follow my progress (and to see if I'm not being a couch potato).

## Lastly what are the plans?

For the moment, the plans are:
- Bringing life to the instagram of the club by showing off our sponsor, and projects
- Managaing the projects like the CDFR (coupe de france de robotique)
- Documenting and posting on the site of the club
- Ensure that overall progress is made


Thats it Folks, I do not have anything to add for this post, as I only have 2h for this time, and had to set up a lot of stuff!
Stay creative, a mostly, be kind!
