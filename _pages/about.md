![Me Dylan Looij](/assets/images/PhotoMe.jpg)


Hi, I'm Dylan, an engineering student at Unilasalle Amiens, my passion lies in technology, everything that has to do with robotics and IoT.

Since my early days, I have been creative thanks to an enabling environment, wanting to develop this trait of mine further, I've pursued the Engineering line to acquire the skills needed to develop my abilities in electronics, robots, and regular objects.

I love being independent of the big companies that rule the world and using my skills, I keep the same lifestyle (maybe even better) as the regular person, but without the need of external businesses to do my stuff (my smarthome system is a self made for example).

Using this website, I document steps of my journey to become a better "inventor" as I like to say it, even if I use things that are already invented, I give them my own twist.
And everything will be available to you too, as I set every project of mine on GitHub (yes yes I know, that's a big company, but this is a secure way to share my work)
