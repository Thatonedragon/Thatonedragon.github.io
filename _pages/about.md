Hi im Dylan, i'm an engineering student at UnilasalleAmiens, my passion lies in thecnology, everything that has to do with robotics and IOT.

Since my early days i have been ceative thanks to a enabling environement, wanting to develop this trait of mine more, i've pursued the Engineering line to acquire the skills need to 
develop my own electronics, robots, and regular objects.

I love being independent from the big companies that rule the world, and using my skills, i keep the same lifestyle (maybe even better) as the regular person.

Using this website, i document every step of my journey to become a better "inventor" as i like to say it, even if i use things that are already invented, i give them my own twist.
