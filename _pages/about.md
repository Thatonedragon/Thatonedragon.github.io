Hi, I'm Dylan, an engineering student at Unilasalle Amiens, my passion lies in technology, everything that has to do with robotics and IoT.

Since my early days, I have been creative thanks to an enabling environment, wanting to develop this trait of mine more, I've pursued the Engineering line to acquire the skills need to 
develop my own electronics, robots, and regular objects.

I love being independent of the big companies that rule the world and using my skills, I keep the same lifestyle (maybe even better) as the regular person.

Using this website, I document every step of my journey to become a better "inventor" as I like to say it, even if I use things that are already invented, I give them my own twist.
And everything will be available to you too, as I set every project of mine on GitHub (yes yes I know, that's a big company, but this is a secure way to share my work)
